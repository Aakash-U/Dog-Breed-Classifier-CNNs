# CNN Dog Breed Classifier

A deep learning image classification system that identifies dog breeds using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project compares three state-of-the-art architectures—ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG—to determine the most effective model for breed classification.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This classifier addresses the challenge of distinguishing between dog breeds, dogs vs non-dogs, and evaluating model performance across different CNN architectures. By leveraging transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models, the system achieves high accuracy without requiring extensive training data or computational resources.

### Key Objectives
- Classify images as dog or non-dog with high precision
- Identify specific dog breeds from 133+ breed categories
- Compare performance across multiple CNN architectures
- Provide actionable insights on model selection for image classification tasks

## 📊 Results

Performance comparison across three CNN architectures on 40 test images (30 dogs, 10 non-dogs):

| Model | Dog Detection | Breed Accuracy | Non-Dog Detection | Overall Match | Runtime |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| **VGG-16** | **100%** | **93.3%** ✨ | **100%** | **90.0%** | 2s |
| ResNet-18 | 100% | 90.0% | 100% | 85.0% | <1s |
| AlexNet | 100% | 80.0% | 100% | 77.5% | <1s |

**Winner: VGG-16** achieves the highest breed classification accuracy (93.3%) while maintaining perfect dog/non-dog detection.

### Key Findings
- All models achieved 100% accuracy in distinguishing dogs from non-dogs
- VGG-16 outperformed lighter models in breed-specific classification
- ResNet-18 offers the best speed-accuracy tradeoff
- AlexNet, while fastest, sacrifices breed accuracy

## 🔍 How It Works

### Pipeline Architecture

1. **Input Processing**: Parse command-line arguments and load image directory
2. **Label Extraction**: Extract ground truth labels from image filenames
3. **CNN Classification**: Pass images through pretrained CNN model
4. **Dog Validation**: Verify if predictions correspond to valid dog breeds
5. **Statistics Calculation**: Compute accuracy, precision, and performance metrics
6. **Results Display**: Output formatted results and runtime statistics

### Model Details

- **VGG-16**: 16-layer deep network, excellent feature extraction, higher computational cost
- **ResNet-18**: 18-layer residual network, skip connections prevent vanishing gradients
- **AlexNet**: 8-layer network, pioneering CNN architecture, fastest inference

All models use ImageNet pretrained weights and classify images into 1000 categories, with dog breeds mapped from a curated list of 133 breeds.

## 🎓 Insights & Learnings

- **Transfer Learning Effectiveness**: Pretrained models significantly reduce training time and data requirements
- **Architecture Tradeoffs**: Deeper networks (VGG) achieve higher accuracy but require more computation
- **Dog Detection vs Breed Classification**: All models excel at binary dog/non-dog classification, but breed-specific accuracy varies significantly
- **Real-World Application**: VGG-16 recommended for production use where accuracy is critical; ResNet-18 for resource-constrained environments

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for custom image uploads via web interface
- [ ] Implement fine-tuning on dog-specific datasets (Stanford Dogs, ImageNet Dogs)
- [ ] Integrate newer architectures (EfficientNet, Vision Transformers)
- [ ] Add confidence scores and top-k predictions
- [ ] Deploy as REST API or web application
- [ ] Expand to multi-label classification (breed + attributes)
